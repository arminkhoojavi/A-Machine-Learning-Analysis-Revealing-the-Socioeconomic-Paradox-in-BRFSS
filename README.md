# Title: Predictors of Smoking Cessation in the U.S.: A Machine Learning Analysis Revealing the Socioeconomic Paradox in BRFSS Data (2018-2023)  |  Team Project (team memmbers: Armin KHoojavi, Hamed Hesami, Mahdieh Ebrahimi) |  Summer 2025 (Academic Project)



# Objective: To provide a deep, multifaceted, and stable understanding of factors influencing successful smoking cessation in adults using extensive BRFSS survey data (2018-2023) to inform personalized interventions.



# Methodology: Employed various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost) for prediction. Evaluated model performance with "all features" vs. "VIF-based feature reduction." Implemented comprehensive modeling approaches including Data Pooling, Temporal Ensemble, and Stacking Ensemble for enhanced accuracy and stability. Used SHAP analysis to assess factor influence and temporal stability.



# Key Contributions:

Developed and evaluated multiple advanced machine learning models, with Stacking Ensemble achieving superior performance (AUC: 0.7881, Accuracy: 0.7446, F1-Score: 0.7330).

Identified and validated stable key predictors of smoking cessation across a six-year period, including older age, marital status, higher income/education, higher BMI, and chronic disease diagnoses (COPD, stroke, diagnosed depression).

Contributed to robust data-driven insights for public health policy and tobacco control by emphasizing personalized, multi-faceted 



# Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
